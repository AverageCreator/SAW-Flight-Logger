How to use it?
First, the script will ask for the pilot cs. The recommended format is: [Airlines ICAO/IATA code + Flight number] operated by [Your discord name, abbreviated too is ok]
Make sure that you've noted the ICAO of both your departure airport and arrival airport,
The script, when you've taken off, will ask you for the departure airport's ICAO code: put it in and then press Enter
Once you've landed and stopped fully, the script will ask you if you want to end the flight: Click yes, and then type the ICAO of the airport of destination and the aircraft's type

In your flight log channel, now you should see a bunch of flight logs messages sent by your webhook
